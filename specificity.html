    <h1>Specificity:</h1>
    <p>the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an
        element and,
        therefore, will be applied. Specificity is based on the matching rules which are composed of different sorts of
        CSS
        selectors.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Specificity is how Chrome decides what property values (colors, sizes, etc.) to apply to a webpage.
        It is done by matching the rules based on the selectors used in html and the stylesheet.</p>

    <h3>The selector types are:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Type selectors (e.g., h1) and pseudo-elements (e.g., ::before).</li>
        <li>Class selectors (e.g., .example), attributes selectors (e.g., [type="radio"]) and pseudo-classes (e.g.,
            :hover).
        </li>
        <li>ID selectors (e.g., #example).s based on the matching rules which are composed of different sorts of CSS
            selectors.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h3>Classes</h3>

<div class="classyClass">When accessing a portion of html with a class, use . on the stylesheet to style.</div>
<p class="classyClass">I am classy, too!</p>

<h3>Elements</h3>

<article>Selectors select elements to alter.</article>

<p>This element is a p-tag, and has been altered in the stylesheet.</p>

<!-- The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the
 HTML document. -->
<!-- The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within
curly braces {}.-->
<h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>
<!-- The paragraph is will be red, even though the ID selector has higher specificity. The !important rule overrides
that particular property. -->
<p id="thing">Will be RED.</p>
<!-- The order of the attributes in the HTML don't matter. It's the order in the stylesheet. Let's focus on the
background: -->
<div class="module module-foo module-bar">
    Module
</div>
<!--Inline Style
Inline is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element-->
<p style="color: darkgreen;">
    This is an example of an inline style
</p>
<!--Combination Selector
    Combination Selectors show the direct relationship between the two selectors-->
<h1 class="fancy-header">Hello there!</h1>
<h2 class="fancy-header">Hey there stranger!</h2>
<!-- What does the "Cascading" mean in "Cascading Style Sheets"?
    Cascading means that styles can fall from one style sheet to another enabling multiple style sheets to be used on one HTML file-->
